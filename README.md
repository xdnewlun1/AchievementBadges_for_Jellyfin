# 🏆 Achievement Badges for Jellyfin

A full progression, gamification and achievement system for Jellyfin that rewards users based on real viewing activity. Think Xbox Gamerscore meets Letterboxd, built natively into your media server.

> **Status:** Feature-complete as of v1.5.11 — the 1.5.12–1.5.18 releases have focused on polish (Xbox-style toasts, gradient tones, banner refinement). Bug fixes and Jellyfin version compatibility will continue; new features will be considered via [pull request](https://github.com/ZL154/AchievementBadges_for_Jellyfin/pulls).

---

## ✨ Overview

Over **170 built-in achievements** across 30+ categories, a 10-tier rank ladder from Rookie to Immortal, a score economy with combos, prestige, and daily/weekly quests, plus admin power features like custom badges, seasonal challenges, webhook notifications and a full audit log.

Designed to integrate cleanly with modern Jellyfin setups and themes like NetFin, ElegantFin, or StarTrack.

---

## 🧩 Core features

### 🏅 Badge system
- **170+ built-in achievements** across Films, Series, Binge, Night Watching, Morning, Weekend, Exploration, Streaks, Episode/Film Marathons, Eras, World, Languages, Genres, Runtime, Total Time, Holidays (Christmas, New Year, Halloween, Eid), Library Completion, Loyalty, People, Rewatch, and Hidden categories
- **6 rarity tiers** — Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic
- **Hidden/secret badges** displayed as `???` until unlocked
- **Library completion milestones** that auto-scale to any library structure
- **Per-person tracking** — Director and Actor affinity badges
- **Per-genre tracking** — unique genre counters with dedicated badges
- **Era / country / language** breakdowns via item metadata
- **Watch streaks** — current and best streak badges
- **Daily login streak** — loyalty rewards for consistent visits

### 🎖️ Rank system
- **10 tiers** from Rookie → Novice → Viewer → Regular → Enthusiast → Binger → Connoisseur → Maestro → Legend → Immortal
- Rank computed from your achievement score with progress bar to next tier
- **Theme unlocks** — the achievements page changes gradient/border color as you climb
- Sidebar badge showcase + header dots display your current equipped badges at a glance

### 💰 Score economy
- Every playback accrues 5 base points into a **score bank**
- **Combo multiplier** — consecutive watches within 15 minutes stack up to +100% bonus
- **Spend bank** to buy locked badges directly
- **Gift score** to other users on your server
- Rarity-based badge scoring (10-150 pts), scaled by prestige level

### ⭐ Prestige
- Reach Legend rank (12,000 score) to unlock prestige
- **Resets badges + counters** but keeps your lifetime score and awards a prestige star
- Each prestige level adds a **+50% score multiplier** to future badge unlocks
- Visible on profile and leaderboard

### 🎯 Daily & weekly quests
- **3 concurrent daily quests** rotating from 12 templates
- **3 concurrent weekly quests** rotating from 8 templates
- Deterministic rotation — everyone on the server gets the same quests per day/week
- Completing quests pays into the score bank

### 📊 Stats & visualization
- **Recap tab** — weekly / monthly / yearly breakdowns with top genres, directors, actors
- **Watch heatmap** — GitHub-style calendar (30/90/180/365 day range) colored by intensity
- **Genre radar chart** — SVG spider chart of your genre distribution
- **Stats snapshot** — histogram of unlocked / score / best streak
- **Category leaderboards** — Score, Movies, Episodes, Hours, Best Streak, Series

### 🏠 UI integration
- **Sidebar entry** auto-injected into the Jellyfin nav menu
- **Equipped badge showcase** in header + profile
- **Xbox-style unlock toasts** that pop up during playback (polled every 30s), with per-rarity glow, shimmer sweep and confetti on rare+ unlocks
- **Admin toast preview** — test buttons in the admin panel fire a sample toast for each rarity tier
- **Standalone achievements page** at `#!/achievements`
- **Shareable profile card** — server-rendered HTML at `/Plugins/AchievementBadges/users/{id}/profile-card`

### 🛠️ Admin features
- **Enable/disable individual badges** — useful if your server can't satisfy some criteria (e.g. not enough libraries)
- **Visual badge editor** — form-based creator for custom badges
- **JSON editor** alternative for power users
- **Seasonal challenges** — time-limited goals with start/end dates
- **Challenge templates** — one-click add for Monthly Marathon, October Horror, New Year, Summer Blockbuster
- **Webhook notifications** — Discord/Slack-compatible POST on every unlock, auto-detects format
- **Audit log** — last 5,000 unlock events with timestamps and user details
- **Progress injection** — set arbitrary counter values for testing / gifting
- **Export / import** profile JSON for server migration
- **Per-badge reset** — wipe a single badge without nuking the whole profile
- **UI feature toggles** — disable toasts, home widget, item ribbon individually
- **Admin auth lockdown** — all admin endpoints require elevated permissions

### 🔒 Tracking
- **Watch history backfill** — scans existing Jellyfin play history to retroactively award badges on install
- **Auto-evaluation on startup** — new badges from plugin updates auto-unlock if your existing counters already satisfy them, no manual scan needed
- **Live playback tracker** — unlocks fire during viewing, past the 80% completion threshold
- **Rewatch detection** — dedupes within 6 hours, counts rewatches beyond that
- **People metadata extraction** — uses `ILibraryManager.GetPeople()` for directors/actors

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Go to **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories**
2. Add:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZL154/AchievementBadges_for_Jellyfin/main/manifest.json
```

3. Save and refresh plugins
4. Install **Achievement Badges**
5. Restart Jellyfin
6. Go to **Dashboard → Plugins → Achievement Badges → Settings**
7. Click **Scan watch history** (or **Scan all users**) to backfill from your existing play data
8. Explore `#!/achievements` to see your profile

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Jellyfin 10.11+**
- **File Transformation plugin** (strongly recommended) — ensures sidebar, dashboard UI, profile showcase and achievements page inject reliably across Jellyfin Web updates. Without it most UI injection still works via the plugin's own middleware, but File Transformation gives the most robust integration.

### Optional but helpful

- **Proper metadata provider** (TMDb, OMDb) — required for Director/Actor badges to populate. Badges based on `item.People` will stay empty if your library doesn't have people scraped
- **Home Screen Sections plugin** — lets the achievement home widget inject more reliably

### What each feature needs

| Feature | Depends on |
|---|---|
| Sidebar + header injection | Nothing (works standalone) |
| Watch history backfill | Played flag on items (Jellyfin default) |
| Genre badges | Items with `Genres` metadata |
| Director/Actor badges | Items with `People` metadata (TMDb/OMDb scrape) |
| Era / decade badges | Items with `ProductionYear` metadata |
| Country badges | Items with `ProductionLocations` metadata |
| Language badges | Items with `OriginalLanguage` metadata |
| Runtime badges | Items with `RunTimeTicks` populated |
| Library completion | At least one library folder with items |
| Webhook notifications | A webhook URL (Discord, Slack, or generic) |

## 📸 Screenshots

### The standalone Achievements page
The full profile view, shown in the Jellyfin sidebar. Rank progress bar, day streak, score, completion percentage, and the tab bar for the seven sub-views (My Badges, Quests, Recap, Leaderboard, Compare, Activity, Wrapped, Stats).

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Achievements page" src="assets/screenshots/achievements-page.png" />
</p>

### Badge grid
171 badges across 30+ categories, each with live progress bars and an Equip button. Unlocked badges show in color with a green status tag; locked badges dim. Rarity-colored borders let you scan the grid visually.

### Daily and weekly quests

</p>

### Recap
Weekly, monthly and yearly breakdowns of what you've actually watched — total items, active days, top genres, top directors, and top actors. (The names below come from media metadata — Breaking Bad and Brooklyn Nine-Nine test libraries.)

### Compare profiles
Head-to-head profile comparison between any two users on your server. Gradient bars show the relative values on 12 core metrics, and the bottom pills break down how many badges each user has that the other doesn't. (Usernames blurred as User 1 / User 2.)
